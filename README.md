# Book Search Engine Starter Code

This application is a full-stack book search engine designed for avid readers who wish to discover and keep track of books they're interested in. Built with a React front-end, Node.js and Express.js server, and MongoDB database, it leverages GraphQL with Apollo Server for efficient and flexible data handling. Users can search for new books via the Google Books API, save their favorites to their account, and manage their saved list. The app features user authentication, allowing users to sign up, log in, and maintain their personal saved books list. It's an ideal tool for book enthusiasts looking to explore a vast selection of books and organize their reading interests in one convenient place.

As with other hw I was unable to deploy becuase I was going to be charged for deployment even though I had the student account.
